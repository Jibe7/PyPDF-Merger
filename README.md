# Project Motivation
I usually used online PDF mergers but I don't like doing that when working with all of my PDFs (especially the ones that are private) as we don't know what is done with our data on these websites.
## Project Goals
1. Be able to merge several PDFs together âœ…
2. Create a user interface where we can drag and drop the PDFs to merge as well as choosing the name and location of the output file.
## Requirements
Use a different Python GUI library that what I used in my previous project (password manager, with customtkinter).
## Project State
Currently I have found how to merge PDFs using pypdf library and used it as it is when I needed it.
Next steps would be to create a GUI so that I don't have to mess with the code each time that I want to do that.
Not mandatory nor urgent, but may be a great improvement.
